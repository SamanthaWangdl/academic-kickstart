I am currently a junior biomedical engineering student from Fudan University, educated as an electrical engineer. 
 My first exposure to research is about a magnetic hat for sports rehabilitation. At that time, the magic bonding between engineering and medicine initiated me towards this hybrid field. To engage in the real medical environment, I volunteered in the palliative hospital to accompany terminal cancer patients and also went to the summer school at Duke-NUS medical school in Singapore.
 I gradually realized that my curiosity towards biomedical engineering and computational neuroscience. And my 4.0 GPA in my second year convinced me that. Meanwhile, thanks to a doctor in the palliative hospital, who gave me inspiration for my new research on pain monitoring, I initiated my first research relevant to pain monitoring and published a conference paper on EMBC 2020.
