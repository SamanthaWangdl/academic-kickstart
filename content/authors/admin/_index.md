I am currently a junior biomedical engineering student from Fudan University, educated as an electrical engineer. I used to dream about becoming an outstanding Neurosurgeon, but now I have committed myself to the biomedical engineering field,
 My first exposure to research is about a magnetic hat for sports rehabilitation. At that time, the magic bonding between engineering and medicine initiated me towards this hybrid field. To engage in the real medical environment, I volunteered in the palliative hospital to accompany terminal cancer patients. At the end of my first year in college, I went to the summer school at Duke-NUS medical school in Singapore, where I grow acquainted with MD and MD-PhD students who guided me into the fabulous medicine world.
However, as I studied more math and engineering courses at school, I gradually realized that my curiosity towards new theories, tenacity towards experiments, and perseverance on deduction catered more to engineering research than medicine. And my 4.0 GPA in my second year convinced me that. Meanwhile, thanks to a doctor in the palliative hospital, who gave me inspiration for my new research on pain monitoring, I initiated my first research not long after. 
Besides,  because I helped a EE professor with some radar image classification work, I was invited to a Japan engineering conference, and my first exposure to academic conference fascinated me towards more comprehensive engineering research. All of these things directed me from medicine to biomedical engineering.
When it came to my pain research, my original idea, which was to use a basic model to classify the skin resistance response, encountered many problems. And these problems prompted me to learn more about biomedical signal processing beyond my curriculum. On the one hand, I learned more pattern recognition methods and employed hybrid RNN to improve accuracy and submitted the result to EMBC. On the other side, I extended my research to the EEG signals and equipped myself with enough EEG processing knowledge.
