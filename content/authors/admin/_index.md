I am currently a junior electrical engineer (biomedical engineering) student from Fudan University with a top 1 GPA score in my major. With a long time volunteering experience in a hospice care center, I have committed myself to biomedical engineering research and innovation ever since. 

My research interest originated from real-clinical problems, like pain monitoring, and ranges from machine learning study in temporal series and graphs to complex network and cybernetics. 

With distinguished undergraduate research granting from a Nobel laureate, I completed a complex network control algorithm design. Besides, I am also engaging in pain monitoring problems and exploring the interpretability of them with the guide from Prof. Gari Clifford.

I will apply for Ph.D. at the end of 2021.
