# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The smallest eigenvalue of a grounded Laplacian matrix plays a pivotal role in complex networks, such as system control, convergence rate and the robustness of a system. In this paper, we focus on the node selection problem of maximizing the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix."
